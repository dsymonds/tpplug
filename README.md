# TPPlug

This is a monitoring exporter for a smart plug I own.

It works with the
[TP-Link HS110](https://www.tp-link.com/au/products/details/cat-5258_HS110.html),
and exports data for use by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

## The protocol

(https://github.com/plasticrake/tplink-smarthome-api was a good starting point.)
